* redmine-gitolite

This version of redmine-gitolite was tested with Redmine 2.0.2
only. It may work with other versions of 2.0 branch but will fail for
sure with Redmine 1.x

This is [[https://github.com/kahseng/redmine_gitolite_hook][Redmine Gitolite Hook]] combined with [[https://github.com/jhogendorn/redmine-gitolite][redmine-gitolite]] 

A Redmine plugin which manages your gitolite configuration based on
your projects and user memberships in Redmine.

Provides Gitolite hook, for automaticaly pulling changes to local
clone of repository. This plugin will create local clone and keep it
up to date.

Includes Public Key management views (extracted from http://plan.io).

* Requirements:

  1. Gitolite server
  2. curl

* Setup:
  1. Install gitolite for user git. In home directory of user git
     : git clone https://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite.git
     : mkdir bin
     : echo "PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH" >> .bashrc
     : gitolite/install -ln
     : gitolite setup -pk redmine.pub
     redmine.pub must be the key generated for user running redmine so
     it will be possible for this user to clone repos locally (see
     next point)

  2. User running redmine (his key must be named named "redmine") must
     have RW+ access to gitolite-admin (assuming that you have
     gitolite installed).

  3. Install Redmine and put this plugin into path_to_redmine/plugins
     directory and migrate database (plugins)
     : $ cd redmine/plugins
     : $ git clone git://github.com/pibako/redmine-gitolite.git
     : $ cd redmine-gitoline
     : $ git checkout -t redmine2
     : $ cd ../../
     : $ RAILS_ENV=production rake redmine:plugins:migrate

  4. Make sure that redmine user has gitolite server in his
     known_host list i.e. ssh to git@your_host and accept

  5. Configure email and name of git user for your redmine account
     : $ git config --global user.email "redmine@gitolite.org"
     : $ git config --global user.name "Redmine Gitolite"

  6. Add post-receive hook to common gitolite hooks (example in
     contrib dir) and configure it (host, api key, etc, see sources)
     : $ sudo su - gitolite #login on gitolite user
     : $ cd /tmp
     : $ git clone git://github.com/pibako/redmine-gitolite.git
     : $ git checkout -t redmine2
     : $ cp /tmp/redmine-gitolite/contrib/hooks/post-receive-redmine_gitolite ~/.gitolite/hooks/common/post-receive
     : $ chmod +x .gitolite/hooks/common/post-receive
     : $ emacs .gitolite/hooks/common/post-receive
     1. enable WS for repository management in
        [Administration -> Settings -> Repositories]
	
     2. copy generated API key
	
     3. configure, in complex hook you can do this by git config options

     4. edit .gitolite.rc
     : add "hooks\.redmine_gitolite\..*" to the GIT_CONFIG_KEYS setting
     : $ gitolite setup

  7. Configure plugin in redmine settings [Adminitration -> Plugins ->
     Redmine Gitolite]
    
     - Gitolite URL should be set to your gitolite-admin git repository

     - Base path should point directory which will hold local copies
       (must exist)

     - Set developer and ro urls as in given examples

     - %{name} will be replaced with your repository identifier

* Pro Tips:
  - You should manage your keys only from Redmine to avoid conflicts.
  - Need new bare git repo? Create it via Redmine, disable other
    features.
  - This is most convenient way to manage keys by your user.
